      You are minding your own business, watching YouTube videos and contemplating whether or not to finally cave in and attempt the latest Instagram stay-home trends when you see a notification on your phone.

      Your group chat immediately starts pinging with messages, and after some debating and polling, it seems that your friends have been bored out of their minds and either want to go out or have a Zoom session to catch up with everyone's lives. The deciding vote was down to you. Which choice do you make?

      You decide to sneak out. You decide that the meeting point is the park near all of your houses. You put on your mask and make your way down to the park. 5 minutes after meeting everybody, your suspiciously large group is questioned by the police officers patrolling and you get detained.
