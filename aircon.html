  <p id=essay><b>Air conditioning</b> (often referred to as <b>AC</b>, <b>A/C</b>, or <b>air con</b>) is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space to improve the comfort of occupants. Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork. <br><br>

Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants (chemicals which remove moisture from the air). Some AC systems reject or store heat in subterranean pipes.

<h2>Why I think Air Conditioning is amazing</h2><hr> 
<p id=essay>Why is the air conditioner so popular? Because it is very cool. Air conditioning is one of the most important facets of modern society, where personal comfort is at an all time high, one could argue that the air conditioner is one of the largest contributors to that. <br><br>

"Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics. Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk. The first thing I did upon becoming prime minister was to install air conditioners in buildings where the civil service worked. This was key to public efficiency." Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore once made the previous claim in an interview for New Perspective. In a temperate, equatorial country like Singapore, the cooling system that takes up 10% of global electricity consumption today is essential and paramount in ensuring its meteoric rise to a global economic superpower. Without air conditioning, the overall efficiency in many countries during the summer (or throughout the year in those like Singapore) would be unimaginably lower. Hence, without air conditioning, it is unimaginable as to how uncomfortable life would be. <br><br>

Ignoring the negative environmental effects and circular nature of the problems its causing, air conditioning can be said to be one of the biggest scientific inventions and a world without it is close to unimaginable. It has become a basic necessity in many workplaces and in many person lives, hence if air conditioning had not been invented, the world might be in a very different place today.<br> </p>
