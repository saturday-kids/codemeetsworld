  <p id=essay> An <b>airplane</b> or <b>aeroplane</b> (informally <b>plane</b>) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones. <br> <br> The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders). Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal also studied heavier-than-air flight. Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.</p> <br>

<h2>Why I think the Airplane is amazing</h2><hr> <p>

  <p id=essay>"The Wright Brothers created the single greatest cultural force since the invention of writing." Bill Gates once mused that the airplane was the beginning of the phenomenon known as globalisation. The airplane made the world a smaller place. Travel that would be impossible in the past was now possible with air travel. This allowed culture, people, language, ideas and values to be brought together and shared. Things that were never thought to be possible were achieved. Airplanes shrunk the globe and have both positive and negative impacts in the way society functions today.<br><br>

Before air travel, it would be seen as outrageous for someone living in Asia to casually want to take a trip to Europe. It might not even have been something that was thought to be possible! However, the ability to fly has allowed us to broaden our horizons and brought the world much closer. This was the foundation for many economic and social actions and policies that have transpired since the advent of air travel.<br><br>

On the flipside, as with everything, there are negatives that have come about due to air travel. For example, the loss of culture and the rapid Americanization of countries that seem to worship the global superpower of America as they spread their influence through media and things.<br><br>

As such, the airplane was a revolutionary breakthrough scientifically and its impact cannot be understated. <br> </p>
